# PYTHON_PROJECT_LIST
Description:
The Python program you've developed is a simple implementation of the classic "Rock-Paper-Scissors" game. It allows the user to choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and then randomly generates the computer's choice. After revealing both choices, the program determines the winner based on the game's rules (Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, Paper beats Rock), or if both players make the same choice, it results in a draw.

Learning Outcomes:
By developing this Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python, you have likely learned and demonstrated the following skills:

1. User Input: You learned how to accept and process user input using the `input()` function, enabling interaction with the user.

2. Lists: You utilized lists to store the ASCII art representations of Rock, Paper, and Scissors images, making it easier to access and display them based on the user's and computer's choices.

3. Randomization: You employed the `random` module in Python to generate the computer's choice randomly, simulating the unpredictability of an opponent's move.

4. Conditionals: You used conditional statements (if-elif-else) to determine the outcome of the game based on the user's and computer's choices.

5. ASCII Art: You used ASCII art to visually represent Rock, Paper, and Scissors, adding a fun and graphical element to the game.

Overall, this project demonstrates your ability to create interactive programs, work with data structures like lists, implement conditional logic, and incorporate randomness into your Python programs. It also showcases your creativity in using ASCII art to enhance the user experience. By completing this project, you've gained practical experience in Python programming and developed a fun game that can entertain and engage users.
